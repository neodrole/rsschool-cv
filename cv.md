### About me
I am 21 years old. I have an interest in programming in general, but I'm not sure which field would suit me best. I have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, JS and Python. Wrote some scripts for personal use. 
I want to create something that will be helpful for people. When a problem is solved, even after I spent the whole night, i'm so happy because it's like some kind of achievement in the game. I believe that creating something useful and meaningful for others gives meaning to my life.
